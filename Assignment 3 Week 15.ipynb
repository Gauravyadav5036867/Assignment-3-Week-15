    "#Question 1\n",
    "\n",
    "Ridge regression, also known as Tikhonov regularization, is a linear regression technique used to mitigate the problem of multicollinearity and overfitting in ordinary least squares (OLS) regression. It achieves this by adding a penalty term to the OLS loss function, which penalizes large coefficients.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's how Ridge regression differs from ordinary least squares regression:\n",
    "\n",
    "Penalty Term:\n",
    "\n",
    "Ridge regression adds a penalty term to the OLS loss function, which is proportional to the squared sum of the coefficients (\n",
    "�\n",
    "2\n",
    "L \n",
    "2\n",
    "​\n",
    "  norm). This penalty term is also known as the regularization term or the ridge penalty.\n",
    "The addition of the penalty term modifies the optimization problem, leading to smaller coefficient estimates compared to OLS regression.\n",
    "In contrast, ordinary least squares regression minimizes the sum of squared residuals without any penalty term.\n",
    "Shrinking Coefficients:\n",
    "\n",
    "The penalty term in Ridge regression shrinks the coefficients towards zero, especially for predictors that are highly correlated with each other.\n",
    "This shrinking effect reduces the variance of the coefficient estimates, making the model less sensitive to changes in the training data and reducing the risk of overfitting.\n",
    "In OLS regression, there is no penalty for large coefficients, so the resulting coefficient estimates may be larger and more susceptible to overfitting, especially in the presence of multicollinearity.\n",
    "Handling Multicollinearity:\n",
    "\n",
    "Ridge regression is particularly useful when multicollinearity is present in the dataset, as it effectively reduces the impact of multicollinearity on the coefficient estimates.\n",
    "Multicollinearity occurs when predictor variables are highly correlated with each other, leading to unstable and unreliable coefficient estimates in OLS regression.\n",
    "By shrinking the coefficients, Ridge regression stabilizes the estimates and provides more reliable predictions, even in the presence of multicollinearity.\n",
    "Regularization Parameter:\n",
    "\n",
    "Ridge regression introduces a regularization parameter (\n",
    "�\n",
    "λ), which controls the strength of regularization. Larger values of \n",
    "�\n",
    "λ result in stronger regularization and more significant shrinkage of coefficients.\n",
    "The choice of the regularization parameter is critical in Ridge regression and is typically determined through cross-validation or other model selection techniques.\n",
    "In OLS regression, there is no regularization parameter to tune, as the model simply minimizes the sum of squared residuals."

    "#Question 2\n",
    "\n",
    "Ridge regression, like ordinary least squares (OLS) regression, relies on certain assumptions to ensure the validity and reliability of its results. While some of the assumptions are shared with OLS regression, Ridge regression also has additional considerations due to the introduction of regularization. Here are the key assumptions of Ridge regression:\n",
    "\n",
    "Linearity: Ridge regression assumes that the relationship between the predictors and the response variable is linear. This means that changes in the predictors are associated with proportional changes in the response variable, even after accounting for the effects of other predictors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Independence: Ridge regression assumes that the observations are independent of each other. In other words, the values of the response variable for one observation are not influenced by the values of the response variable for other observations. Violation of this assumption can lead to biased coefficient estimates and unreliable predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Homoscedasticity: Like OLS regression, Ridge regression assumes homoscedasticity, meaning that the variance of the errors is constant across all levels of the predictors. In other words, the spread of the residuals should be consistent across the range of predicted values. Violations of homoscedasticity can lead to inefficient coefficient estimates and unreliable inference.\n",
    "\n",
    "Normality of Residuals: Ridge regression assumes that the residuals (the differences between the observed and predicted values) are normally distributed. This assumption ensures that the statistical tests and confidence intervals derived from the model are valid. While Ridge regression is relatively robust to violations of this assumption, departures from normality may affect the accuracy of hypothesis tests and confidence intervals.\n",
    "\n",
    "Absence of Perfect Multicollinearity: Ridge regression assumes that there is no perfect multicollinearity among the predictors, meaning that no predictor is a perfect linear combination of other predictors. Perfect multicollinearity can lead to non-unique coefficient estimates and numerical instability in the estimation process. Ridge regression is particularly useful in cases where multicollinearity is present, as it helps stabilize the coefficient estimates and reduce the impact of multicollinearity on the results."
